# ASD-ACC-Transfer-Net

This repo contains the parameters for both EM and Tol-Blue CNNs from: Comparing neuroanatomists’ and artificial intelligence’s methods of extracting features and neighborhoods of axon pathology in autism spectrum disorder.

These CNNs have been trained specifically on the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)/Area 32, and are results of transfer learning using the Inception v1 architecture.
